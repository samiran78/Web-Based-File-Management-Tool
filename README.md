## Using the Files Folder

This web-based notebook application utilizes a local "Files" folder to store user-generated data.

**1. Create the "Files" Folder irst From where we can access,manage our files:**

    - In the same directory as your application's main JavaScript file (usually `index.js`), create a folder named "Files".

**2. Interacting with Files:**

    - The application interacts with files within the "Files" folder for reading, writing, and managing user-generated content.(Usuing fs modules)
    - Ensure that the "Files" folder has the necessary permissions for the application to access these files.

**Note:** The "Files" folder is deliberately excluded from the Git repository for the following reasons:
    - **Personal/Temporary Data:** It's intended to store user-specific data, temporary files, or other content not directly related to the application's core functionality.
    - **Large File Size:** Including it can significantly increase the repository size, impacting cloning and management.
    - **Security:** Uploading sensitive data to a public repository might pose security risks.

    * [ ] **File Creation:** Create new files within the "Files" folder.
* [ ] **File Reading:** Read the contents of existing files.
* [ ] **File Writing:** Write data to files.
* [ ] **File Deletion:** Delete files.
* [ ] **File Renaming:** Rename files.
* [ ] **File Listing:** Display a list of files within the "Files" folder.
* [ ] **[Add more features as needed]**
This project provides a basic web-based interface for managing files.
